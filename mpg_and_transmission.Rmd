## Exploring the Data

Just by taking a quick look at the data, we can see that the means of fuel efficiencies in miles per gallon for cars without automatic transmission (`r round(mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 1]), 2)`) differs from that of cars with automatic transmission(`r round(mean(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 0]), 2)`). This, however, does not control for all the other factors that might be confounding that mean nor does it account for the variability of the data.

```{r singleLinear, include = FALSE}
singleFit <- lm(mpg ~ factor(am), mtcars)
```

If we regress mpg against transmission type by itself, we get a significant result to the .001 level.
